eyerobot is software that allows people to control physical robots using their gaze. eyerobot currently controls a [Sphero](http://www.sphero.com/sphero), but could be extended to support other kinds of robots.

Developed by Alexis Anand, Jake Carlson, and Kendall Sahl at the University of Washington for a the CSE Accessibility Capstone.

## About
eyerobot uses a web camera pointed at the outside world, along with an eye-tracking headset to get the user's gaze position on a real-time image of the robot's environment. eyerobot rolls the Sphero, using the gaze position as the destination.
